                <brief>Test that non-ascii characters work as input to QDoc commands.</brief>
                <para>The purpose of this test data is to provide a regression mechanism as part of QDoc's end-to-end test, tst_generatedOutput, for an issue (QTBUG-64506) that was reported against QDoc's \section1 command. The issue, as experienced by the reporter of the bug, is that if the \section1 command is followed by a non-ascii character (for example Chinese characters), navigation links aren't generated for the section title. The bug was filed against Qt 5.9.2. This test case aims at reproducing the issue as filed by the reporter.</para>

                    <para>If this section generates a duplicate anchor, &quot;3D&quot;, it's because 3D is the only part of the section title QDoc recognizes. This is an error caused by the same bug, and the link should somehow reflect that QDoc encountered the Chinese (or any non-ascii) characters instead.</para>

                    <para>A whole range of ascii characters are not printable ascii characters. These could also cause issues for QDoc. This section is here to confirm linking to such section titles works as expected. It's made a section2 to exercise the behavior for other section levels than 1.</para>
