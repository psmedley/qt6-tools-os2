                <brief>Test that the \brief command doesn't eat content that follows it.</brief>
                <para>The purpose of this test data is to provide a regression mechanism as part of QDoc's end-to-end test, tst_generatedOutput, for an issue (QTBUG-70959) that was reported against QDoc's \keyword command. The issue, as experienced by the reporter of the bug, is that if the \keyword command isn't followed by a new command, or is the last command in a paragraph, the following paragraph is &quot;eaten&quot;. That means the entire paragraph is understood by QDoc as keywords and included as html meta information instead of as part of the rendered output.</para>
